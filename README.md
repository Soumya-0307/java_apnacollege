## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.

## Data Structures

### Concept

Data structures are fundamental building blocks used to organize and store data efficiently. In Java, these include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, among others.

## Algorithms

### Concept

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or methods for solving computational problems. This repository includes implementations of sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort), searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search), and graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).

## Usage

Examples of how to use the implemented data structures and algorithms can be found in the respective directories. Detailed explanations and code samples are provided to demonstrate their functionality.
